= gitlab-ci helper scripts for OpenEmbedded builds

This project contains gitlab-ci config snippets and associated script
to help in building an OpenEmbedded-based project.

This includes:

- support for building for several platforms
- support for building images or SDK
- publication of package feeds
- publication of shared-state for reuse by developpers
- offload of build artifacts through rsync servers, as gitlab does not
  support large-enough artifacts
- support for platform-specific branches using a branch prefix
  (eg. `board1/master`)
- persistence of downloads and shared-state directories
- different downloads directories between major poky versions
- different shared-state directories when you decide it (typically on
  toolchain change)
- copy-on-write shared-state for use in dev branches to limit cache
  polution and inflation (eg. `BUILD_GEN: 1.2+mytest`)
- (non-optional) usage of buildhistory repo and PR server
- buildhistory stored in seprate branches for each platform and each
  source branch
- archiving of interesting task logs as build artifacts (filtering out
  setscene and rm_work)

== assumptions on project setup

- hosted by gitlab 12.0 or higher (for multiple `extends`)
- this repository is included in your project repo as `/ci` (eg. using
  git submodule or subtree)
- yocto project's Poky repository is available in your project repo as
  `/poky`
- all other layers are available after checkout
- `$BUILDHISTREPO` must be writable from your gitlab-ci user
- you have set up a PR server, accessible from your runner (which
  assumes both are located inside of a trusted network)

This has been only used with a submodule-based setup, other setups may
work too (eg. using git subtrees or Android's `repo`), examples and
patches welcomed.

== current limitations

- assumes a single shell runner containing all tools required to build
  your project
- the shared-state and download dirs are kept in the runner
- to have the CI build for a given target plaform from a given branch
  of your source repository where it was never CI-built before, you
  must first push the `$BRANCHPREFIX_ARCH/$BASEBRANCHNAME` first
- lots of `siginfo` files in the shared-state get just their timestamp
  modified, resulting in much more rsync work than really needed
- usage through a submodule hits a limitation of current gitlab, where
  we must refer to the same submodule sha1 in the `gitlab-ci.yml`'s
  `include:file` statement

planned evolutions:

- support docker-based runners
- get gitlab-ci to support submodules natively
- add a safety net to avoid sha1 discrepancy between `/ci` and
  `/.gitlab-ci.yml`
